# RealTimePhysicalModelOfPersianSantur
The Santur is an old Persian instrument that falls under the dulcimer family. It consists of 18 notes, each with 4 strings, alternating between sets of brass and steel. The strings are excited with wooden hammers called Mezr√†b, resulting in a vibrant sound. This project presents a real-time implementation of a physical model of the Santur. The result is a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) which can be used for audio production. Using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods, the physical model is implemented. Due to time limitations, the impact model of the hammers could not be implemented but instead, a triangular excitation was used. Although the results show that the synthesized samples are perceived to be less realistic than the real recordings, several participants stated that it was difficult to tell the synthetic renderings from the recorded samples.
